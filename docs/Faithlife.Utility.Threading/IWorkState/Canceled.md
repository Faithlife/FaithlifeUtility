# IWorkState.Canceled property

Gets a value indicating whether the work is canceled.

```csharp
public bool Canceled { get; }
```

## Property Value

`true` if canceled; otherwise, `false`.

## Remarks

This property should be polled periodically by the work callback to determine whether the work has been canceled. If this property is `true`, the callback should return as quickly as possible, cancelling any work that it was doing.
