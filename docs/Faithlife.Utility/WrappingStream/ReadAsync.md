# WrappingStream.ReadAsync method

Asynchronously reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream, advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read, and monitors cancellation requests.

```csharp
public override Task<int> ReadAsync(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken)
```
