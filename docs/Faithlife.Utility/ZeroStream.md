A stream of zeroes.

```csharp
public class ZeroStream : Stream
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [ZeroStream](ZeroStream/ZeroStream.md)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`ZeroStream`](ZeroStream.md) class. |
| [ZeroStream](ZeroStream/ZeroStream.md)(…) | Initializes a new instance of the [`ZeroStream`](ZeroStream.md) class. |
| override [CanRead](ZeroStream/CanRead.md) { get; } | Returns whether the current stream supports reading. |
| override [CanSeek](ZeroStream/CanSeek.md) { get; } | Returns whether the current stream supports seeking. |
| override [CanWrite](ZeroStream/CanWrite.md) { get; } | Returns whether the current stream supports writing. |
| override [Length](ZeroStream/Length.md) { get; } | Gets the length in bytes of the stream. |
| override [Position](ZeroStream/Position.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [Flush](ZeroStream/Flush.md)() | Flushes the stream. |
| override [Read](ZeroStream/Read.md)(…) | Reads zeroes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| override [Seek](ZeroStream/Seek.md)(…) | Sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [SetLength](ZeroStream/SetLength.md)(…) | Sets the length of the current stream. |
| override [Write](ZeroStream/Write.md)(…) | Writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |

## Remarks

The stream tracks position and length like any stream, but any bytes written to the stream will be read as zeroes.
