# IHasEquivalence&lt;T&gt; interface

Implemented by reference classes that do not want to implement IEquatable{T}, but do want to support some form of equivalence.

```csharp
public interface IHasEquivalence<T>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The class type. |

## Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [IsEquivalentTo](IHasEquivalence-1/IsEquivalentTo.md)(…) | Determines whether the object is equivalent to the specified object. |

## Remarks

This interface is similar to IEquatable{T}, but avoids the baggage of hash codes, overloaded equality operators, immutability requirements, etc.
