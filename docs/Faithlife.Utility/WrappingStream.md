# WrappingStream class

A Stream that wraps another stream. One major feature of [`WrappingStream`](WrappingStream.md) is that it does not dispose the underlying stream when it is disposed if Ownership.None is used; this is useful when using classes such as BinaryReaderthat take ownership of the stream passed to their constructors.

```csharp
public class WrappingStream : Stream
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [WrappingStream](WrappingStream/WrappingStream.md)(…) | Initializes a new instance of the [`WrappingStream`](WrappingStream.md) class. |
| override [CanRead](WrappingStream/CanRead.md) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports reading. |
| override [CanSeek](WrappingStream/CanSeek.md) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports seeking. |
| override [CanTimeout](WrappingStream/CanTimeout.md) { get; } | Gets a value that determines whether the current stream can time out. |
| override [CanWrite](WrappingStream/CanWrite.md) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing. |
| override [Length](WrappingStream/Length.md) { get; } | Gets the length in bytes of the stream. |
| override [Position](WrappingStream/Position.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [ReadTimeout](WrappingStream/ReadTimeout.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value, in miliseconds, that determines how long the stream will attempt to read before timing out. |
| override [WriteTimeout](WrappingStream/WriteTimeout.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets a value, in miliseconds, that determines how long the stream will attempt to write before timing out. |
| override [CopyToAsync](WrappingStream/CopyToAsync.md)(…) | Asynchronously reads the bytes from the current stream and writes them to another stream, using a specified buffer size and cancellation token. |
| override [Flush](WrappingStream/Flush.md)() | Clears all buffers for this stream and causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device. |
| override [FlushAsync](WrappingStream/FlushAsync.md)(…) | Asynchronously clears all buffers for this stream, causes any buffered data to be written to the underlying device, and monitors cancellation requests. |
| override [Read](WrappingStream/Read.md)(…) | Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| override [ReadAsync](WrappingStream/ReadAsync.md)(…) | Asynchronously reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream, advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read, and monitors cancellation requests. |
| override [ReadByte](WrappingStream/ReadByte.md)() | Reads a byte from the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte, or returns -1 if at the end of the stream. |
| override [Seek](WrappingStream/Seek.md)(…) | Sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [SetLength](WrappingStream/SetLength.md)(…) | Sets the length of the current stream. |
| override [Write](WrappingStream/Write.md)(…) | Writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |
| override [WriteAsync](WrappingStream/WriteAsync.md)(…) | Asynchronously writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream, advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written, and monitors cancellation requests. |
| override [WriteByte](WrappingStream/WriteByte.md)(…) | Writes a byte to the current position in the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte. |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [WrappedStream](WrappingStream/WrappedStream.md) { get; } | Gets the wrapped stream. |
| override [Dispose](WrappingStream/Dispose.md)(…) | Disposes or releases the wrapped stream, based on the value of the Ownership parameter passed to the constructor. |
| [ThrowIfDisposed](WrappingStream/ThrowIfDisposed.md)() | Throws an ObjectDisposedException if the [`WrappingStream`](WrappingStream.md) has been disposed. |
