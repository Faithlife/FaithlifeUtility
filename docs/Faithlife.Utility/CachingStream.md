# CachingStream class

A [`WrappingStream`](WrappingStream.md) that caches all data read from the underlying Stream.

```csharp
public sealed class CachingStream : WrappingStream
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [CachingStream](CachingStream/CachingStream.md)(…) | Initializes a new instance of the [`CachingStream`](CachingStream.md) class. |
| override [CanWrite](CachingStream/CanWrite.md) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether the current stream supports writing. |
| override [Position](CachingStream/Position.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [BeginWrite](CachingStream/BeginWrite.md)(…) | Begins an asynchronous write operation. |
| override [EndWrite](CachingStream/EndWrite.md)(…) | Waits for the pending asynchronous read to complete. |
| override [Read](CachingStream/Read.md)(…) | Reads a sequence of bytes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read. |
| override [ReadByte](CachingStream/ReadByte.md)() | Reads a byte from the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte, or returns -1 if at the end of the stream. |
| override [Seek](CachingStream/Seek.md)(…) | Sets the position within the current stream. |
| override [SetLength](CachingStream/SetLength.md)(…) | Sets the length of the current stream. |
| override [Write](CachingStream/Write.md)(…) | Writes a sequence of bytes to the current stream and advances the current position within this stream by the number of bytes written. |
| override [WriteByte](CachingStream/WriteByte.md)(…) | Writes a byte to the current position in the stream and advances the position within the stream by one byte. |

## Protected Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| override [Dispose](CachingStream/Dispose.md)(…) | Disposes or releases the cached stream, based on the value of the Ownership parameter passed to the constructor. |

## Remarks

This implementation doesn't enforce any upper bound on the amount of data that will be cached in memory.
