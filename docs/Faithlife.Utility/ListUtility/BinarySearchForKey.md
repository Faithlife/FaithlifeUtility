# ListUtility.BinarySearchForKey&lt;TItem,TKey&gt; method

Searches a sorted list for a key via binary search. The list must be sorted by the ordering in the passed comparison.

```csharp
public static int BinarySearchForKey<TItem, TKey>(IReadOnlyList<TItem> list, TKey key, 
    Func<TItem, TKey, int> compare, out int index)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| list | The sorted list to search. |
| key | The key to search for. |
| compare | The comparison. |
| index | Returns the first index at which the key can be found. If the return value is zero, indicating that *key* was not present in the list, then this returns the index at which *key* could be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list. |
