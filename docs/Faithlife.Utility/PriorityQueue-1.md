# PriorityQueue&lt;T&gt; class

Implements a [priority queue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) using a [binary heap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_heap). The priority queue is sorted so that the smallest item is removed from the queue first.

```csharp
public sealed class PriorityQueue<T> : ICollection, IEnumerable<T>
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of data to be sorted in the priority queue. |

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [PriorityQueue](PriorityQueue-1/PriorityQueue.md)() | Initializes a new instance of the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md) class that is empty, has the default initial capacity, and is sorted according to the default Comparer for the type of the data. |
| [PriorityQueue](PriorityQueue-1/PriorityQueue.md)(…) | Initializes a new instance of the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md) class that is empty, has the specified initial capacity, and is sorted according to the default Comparer for the type of the data. (3 constructors) |
| [Capacity](PriorityQueue-1/Capacity.md) { get; set; } | Gets or sets the number of elements that the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md) can contain. |
| [Count](PriorityQueue-1/Count.md) { get; } | Gets the number of elements contained in the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md). |
| [CopyTo](PriorityQueue-1/CopyTo.md)(…) | Copies the elements of the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md) to an existing one-dimensional Array, starting at a particular array index. |
| [Dequeue](PriorityQueue-1/Dequeue.md)() | Removes and returns the smallest item from the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md). This operation takes O(log n) time. |
| [Enqueue](PriorityQueue-1/Enqueue.md)(…) | Adds an object to the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md). This operation takes O(log n) time. |
| [Peek](PriorityQueue-1/Peek.md)() | Returns (without removing) the smallest item in the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md). This operation takes O(1) time. |
| [Remove](PriorityQueue-1/Remove.md)(…) | Removes the first item equal to *item* in the priority queue. |
| [RepositionHead](PriorityQueue-1/RepositionHead.md)() | Puts the item at the head of the queue into the correct place. If you modify the item returned by [`Peek`](PriorityQueue-1/Peek.md) such that its "priority" changes, call this method to restore the correct order in the [`PriorityQueue`](PriorityQueue-1.md). |
| [SwapHead](PriorityQueue-1/SwapHead.md)(…) | Swaps the item at the head of the queue with a new item. The new item will be placed into the correct location in the priority queue. |
