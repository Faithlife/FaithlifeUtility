# EnumerableUtility.CountIsExactly&lt;T&gt; method

Returns true if the count is as specified.

```csharp
public static bool CountIsExactly<T>(this IEnumerable<T> seq, int nCount)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of the element. |
| seq | The sequence. |
| nCount | The count. |

## Return Value

True if the count is as specified.

## Remarks

This method will often be faster than calling Enumerable.Count() and testing that value when the count may be much larger than the count being tested.
