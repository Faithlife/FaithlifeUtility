# EnumerableUtility.AsReadOnlyList&lt;T&gt; method

Represents the sequence as an IReadOnlyList.

```csharp
public static IReadOnlyList<T> AsReadOnlyList<T>(this IEnumerable<T> source)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of items in the collection. |
| source | The sequence. |

## Return Value

An IReadOnlyList containing the items in the sequence.

## Remarks

If the sequence is an IReadOnlyList, it is returned directly. If it is an IList, an adapter is created to wrap it. Otherwise, the sequence is copied into a List and then wrapped in a ReadOnlyCollection. This method is useful for forcing evaluation of a potentially lazy sequence while retaining reasonable performance for sequences that are already an IReadOnlyList or IList.
