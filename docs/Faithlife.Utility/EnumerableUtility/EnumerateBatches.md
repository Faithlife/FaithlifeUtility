# EnumerableUtility.EnumerateBatches&lt;T&gt; method (1 of 2)

Enumerates a sequence of elements in batches.

```csharp
public static IEnumerable<ReadOnlyCollection<T>> EnumerateBatches<T>(this IEnumerable<T> sequence, Func<T, bool> startsNewBatch)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| T | The type of object in the sequence. |
| sequence | The sequence of elements to process in batches. |
| startsNewBatch | Should return true if the item should start a new batch. |

## Return Value

Batches of collections containing the elements from the source sequence.

## Remarks

The contents of each batch are eagerly enumerated, to avoid potential errors caused by not fully evaluating each batch (the inner enumerator) before advancing the outer enumerator.
