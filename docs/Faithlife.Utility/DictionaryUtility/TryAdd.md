# DictionaryUtility.TryAdd&lt;TKey,TValue&gt; method

Tries to add a value to the dictionary.

```csharp
public static bool TryAdd<TKey, TValue>(this IDictionary<TKey, TValue> dictionary, TKey key, 
    TValue value)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| TKey | The type of the key. |
| TValue | The type of the value. |
| dictionary | The dictionary. |
| key | The key. |
| value | The value. |

## Return Value

True if successful, i.e. the key was not already in the dictionary.

## Remarks

Unfortunately, there is no more efficient way to do this on an IDictionary than to check ContainsKey before calling Add.
