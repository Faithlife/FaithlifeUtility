# DictionaryUtility.AsReadOnlyDictionary&lt;TKey,TValue&gt; method

Represents the sequence of key-value pairs as a IReadOnlyDictionary.

```csharp
public static IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue> AsReadOnlyDictionary<TKey, TValue>(this IEnumerable<KeyValuePair<TKey, TValue>> keyValuePairs)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| TKey | The type of the key. |
| TValue | The type of the value. |
| keyValuePairs | The key-value pairs. |

## Return Value

A IReadOnlyDictionary containing the key-value pairs in the sequence.

## Remarks

If the sequence is an IReadOnlyDictionary, it is returned directly. If it is an IDictionary, an adapter is created to wrap it. Otherwise, the sequence is copied into a Dictionary and then wrapped in a ReadOnlyDictionary. This method is useful for forcing evaluation of a potentially lazy sequence while retaining reasonable performance for sequences that are already an IReadOnlyDictionary or IDictionary.
