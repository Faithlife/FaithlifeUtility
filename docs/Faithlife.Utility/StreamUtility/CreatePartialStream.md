# StreamUtility.CreatePartialStream method

Uses [`RebasedStream`](../RebasedStream.md) and/or [`TruncatedStream`](../TruncatedStream.md) to create a read-only partial stream wrapper.

```csharp
public static Stream CreatePartialStream(Stream stream, long offset, long? length, 
    Ownership ownership)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| stream | The stream to wrap. |
| offset | The desired offset into the wrapped stream, which is immediately seeked to that position. |
| length | The desired length of the partial stream (optional). |
| ownership | Indicates the ownership of the wrapped stream. |

## Return Value
