# StreamUtility.ReadBlockAsync method

Reads *count* bytes from *stream* into *buffer*, starting at the byte given by *offset*.

```csharp
public static Task<int> ReadBlockAsync(this Stream stream, byte[] buffer, int offset, int count, 
    CancellationToken cancellationToken = default(CancellationToken))
```

| parameter | description |

| buffer | The buffer to read data into. |
| offset | The offset within the buffer at which data is first written. |
| count | The count of bytes to read. |
