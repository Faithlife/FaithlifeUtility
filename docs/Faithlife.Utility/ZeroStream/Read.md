# ZeroStream.Read method

Reads zeroes from the current stream and advances the position within the stream by the number of bytes read.

```csharp
public override int Read(byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| buffer | The target array. |
| offset | The zero-based byte offset in the buffer. |
| count | The maximum number of bytes to be read from the current stream. |

## Return Value

The total number of bytes read into the buffer. This can be less than the number of bytes requested if that many bytes are not currently available, or zero (0) if the end of the stream has been reached.
