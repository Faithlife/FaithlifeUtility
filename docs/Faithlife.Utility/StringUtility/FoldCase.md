# StringUtility.FoldCase method

Performs a full case folding as defined by Section 5.18 of the Unicode Standard 5.0.

```csharp
public static string FoldCase(this string value)
```

| parameter | description |
| --- | --- |
| value | The string to be case-folded. |

## Return Value

A case-folded version of the input string. This value may be longer than the input.

## Remarks

This function is generated from the Unicode case folding data by Tools/src/GenerateCaseFolding.

From http://unicode.org/reports/tr21/tr21-5.html#Caseless_Matching: Case-folding is the process of mapping strings to a canonical form where case differences are erased. Case-folding allows for fast caseless matches in lookups, since only binary comparison is required. Case-folding is more than just conversion to lowercase.

Case folding is not culture aware. String comparisons that should be culture aware should not use this method.
